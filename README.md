A report of the article "Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection", published 10/10/2024, by Robin Frehner, Kurt Stockinger (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04154).
I recreated the classical baseline and the higher performance quantum autoencoder ansatz, to verify their conclusions and to get some extra insight and experience.
